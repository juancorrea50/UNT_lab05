THE FOLLOWING IS A COPY OF THE ASSIGNMENT FROM UNT CSCE 1040 LAB. ALL RIGHTS ARE RESERVED FOR UNT AND THEIR STAFF AS WELL AS THE PROFESSOR AND HIS TA'S AND IA'S

"You are to create a solution and write a program to implement that solution for the problem described below. You must complete and turn in your solution by the end of the exam period. NOTE: No STL is allowed for this assignment.  This means vectors are not allowed!! You will have 1 hr and 20 minutes (80 minutes) to complete the assignment once you begin. you must zip your three files together so that there is only a single file to submit. The time has an extra 10 minutes added to accommodate his part of the work. You should complete your actual coding in 80 minutes to allow the remaining 10 minutes to prepare and submit your solution.You should turn in a total of files: one .h and one .cpp file for the class you are asked to create and one .cpp file for the main program.  

You are to work individually. You should utilize CSE CELL Machines for doing development and compiling. 
Each program specifies a file name. You must use that file name and also include a comment in your code with the problem number you received and another comment with your name. 
The input data file, if any, will be specified in the problem. You will use command line redirection (prog < file) to receive the data in your program. If you prefer you may use file I/O but that is more difficult. You may use either C or C++ styles for I/O, Strings and dynamic memory management. NOTE: We will compile with g++ *.cpp. Do not include any .cpp files in any other files, and don't forget you .h files"

All beginning code was done in vim and compiled from linux machine servers.

Further edits are done on VSCode.
